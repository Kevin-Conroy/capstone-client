FOOD ON TOUR

As a touring musician for over a decade I can attest to the importance of a great meal or dining experience to break up the monotony of spending hours every single day getting from one city (or country!) to the next. FOOD ON TOUR is a one-stop interactive source where touring artists & crews can create a profile with some of their favorite go-to spots from all over the globe. Gone are the days of "Wait...what was that fallafal spot Mike took us to last time we were here?" Food on Tour will get you fed, and keep you hungry for your next culinary adventure!
