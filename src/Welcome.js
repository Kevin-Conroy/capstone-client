        Nothing can break up a long day of travel like a great plate. This app
        was created by touring musicians who love food. We wanted to create a
        space to both find and share some great spots! To get started, create a
        profile. From there, you'll be able to start searching, sharing, and
        even putting together your own "bucket list" of places you can't wait to
        check out. Have fun & eat up!<br></br>
